# Handbook for Participants

It is very exciting to participate in a sprint. Here is a guide to help you prepare yourself and know a bit more about what you can expect from the sprint if this is your first time joining a mentored sprint.

## What is a mentored sprint?

A sprint in general term is an event or meeting that people gather in order to get certain goals in a project done. The sprint that you are going to join will be focusing on contributing to open-source projects. There a lot's of different types of contribution that you may be making. From bugs fixing to checking typos in the documentation or user testings.

A mentored sprint is a sprint that there will be mentors, usually, they are maintainers of the projects that you are going to work on or senior contributors in those projects. They will provide guidance to new contributors, including how to set up the developing environment or tools needed and telling them where to find suitable issues to work on.

## What will I be expecting?

You will be expecting to work with people who are welcoming and happy to help you get started. You will be contributing to an open-source project by making pull requests, reporting issues or any other means of contributions that your mentor suggested. During the process, you will be learning something new. It could be acquiring new knowledge about the project that you worked on, process of setting up an open-source project, or standard of creating documentation etc. It could be anything.

## What do I need to prepare before joining the sprint?

As a participant, the most important thing is to make sure you are going to enjoy the sprint, it can be an exciting learning journey followed with a great sense of achievement. Here are a few things that would give you a head start.

### 1. Read and make sure you understand the code of conduct

To make sure everyone works together in a safe and welcoming environment, make sure you have read and understood the code of conduct. Also, check how you can report a violation. Ask the organisers if there are any questions.

### 2. Prepare the conferencing and chatting tools

Since the sprint will be carried out online. Before you can join, make sure you have installed the conferencing and chatting tools that will be used during the sprint. Usually, using the tools with their corresponding desktop app can ensure a connection and function stability over the browser version. Therefore we highly recommend you have those installed. If you have to register a free account for login, go ahead and do so.

### 3. Prepare git and GitHub

The most common tool for collaborating in an open-source project is git - a free multi-version concurrency control tool. Some OS comes with git, however, if you need to, you can download it by following the guide at git-scm.com: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Most open-source projects will use GitHub to host their source code. Registering an account on GitHub is free: http://github.com/

Occasionally, the project that you wants to work on may have setups other than git and GitHub, check the information provided by the organisers or mentors and follow the instructions that are given.

### 4. Pick a project

This one is optional, as some sprints may have the projects briefing at the beginning of the sprint rather than before. You can always make up your mind later. However, if you want to, you can check out the projects that are participating in the sprints. See if you like any of the projects, do they have interesting issues on their repo that you would like to work on.
