## The people of sprints

Let's consider the types of folks involved in the sprints and  their top-level resposibilities.

| Role                                          | Resposibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Organising teams / Sprint leads               | - Main point of contact  - Delegate tasks and ensure these are on track - Liaise with conference or summit organisers (if embedded in a larger event)                                                                                                                                               |
| Mentors (project)                             | - Onboard new members to a specific project  - help with project-specific questions and pull request reviews - Ensure there are a diverse set of tasks to work on the day (i.e. beginner-friendly, code and non-code issues, translations) - Celebrate wins of their mentees and report on progress |
| General mentors                               | We normally ensure we have a mix of: - Beginners' mentors: general questions - Git helpdesk                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Code of Conduct enforcement team / moderators | Trained folks ready to deal with Code of conduct violations and keeping eye on the communication channels.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Participants/mentees                          | Contribute to the projects involved in the sprints                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Since this chapter is focused on the organisation of the teams we will dive into the main organisers' responsibilities.


### Organising team - Sprints leads

The first step is to identify how many hands you're going to need to be able to run the event. In terms of organisers make sure to:

- Include folks with experience running sprints or community events.
- Have a diverse set of organisers.
- If you are running an event online make sure to have organisers at the timezones/regions you are atrgeting. They will be the best allies to get the word out to the local communities and perhaps you do not want to run a 24hrs sprint on your own. 
- Keep track of the meetings, record meetings if possible (especially when working across timezones, trust me it is really hard to set meeting times when you have folks in JST, BST, CST and PDT timezones).

Be clear with your volunteer and organizing teams about the roles and their responsibilities.Be mindful and clear about time expectations especially if you are all volunteers.
Take time early on to define the roles you need and set expectations. In your communications, be clear about who is handling what, and how folks can be contacted.

#### Tools for organisers

Some tools we have used to communicate with and work as team are:

- [Discord ](https://discord.com/)
- [Slack ](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/)
- [Notion ](https://www.notion.so/) (to keep record of the minutes, last mile planning, and roles)
-  GitHub issue tracker and boards (to keep track of tasks, assign tasks and start asynchronous discussions)
- Zoom, Meet, Teams for regular calls
- [Clickup](https://clickup.com/) (you can sync to GitHub, your calendar and create tasks from emails making it a one stop for to do's)

To support virtual collaboration or events you will need a space online. Slack has become popular because it’s easier to use than IRC. However it is very easy to reach the limitation of the "free" levels. This means the back scroll is not accessible or searchable. The costs for making Slack teams accessible is exorbitant and charges increase as you grow making them unsuitable for open source projects run by volunteers (and with limited budget).

Some open source alternatives are [Mattermost or Riot](https://medium.com/ignation/time-to-replace-slack-who-will-win-mattermost-or-riot-matrix-a090e9cdc219). If you can’t or are not interested in running your own server, consider [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) or [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/). We at Mentored Sprints use [Discord](https://discord.com) as this allows us to set both text and voice channels per project and different levels of moderation.
