## Getting ready for the sprint

This might be your first sprint so make sure to check the other sections in this handbook.
Particularly make sure to install all needed tools as described in [What do I need?](http://127.0.0.1:8000/participants/01-index/#what-do-i-need-to-prepare-before-joining-the-sprint)

TODO: Add link

**In general you will need:**

1. A computer with Internet connection
2. Git installed
3. A GitHub account
4. Your favourite text editor / IDE
5. A working development environment for the project you will be working on
6. A Duckly account and needed plugins

!!!tip
    We have listed the participating projects in this page. We highly recommend you to come prepared
    and check the **Contributing guidelines** as well as the **Setting up your development environment** before the sprint.

### Sharing your screen and code

We know pair programming and remote debugging can be challenging. This year we are using Duckly.
Duckly is a video chat and real-time collaboration tool built for teams. It enables distributed teams to talk and work together in a better and more efficient way. With Duckly you can share a web page, your code directly from your IDE, share your terminal, screen and collaborate as if you were side-by-side.

**You should have received an invite link to join the Duckly team space**.
To get started follow these steps:

1. Create a Duckly account and select your username: <https://duckly.com/onboarding>

2. Click on the invite link and join the mentored-sprints team

3. Install the relevant plugins based on which IDE you use: <https://duckly.com/faq> or <https://duckly.com/tools>

You can check the getting started with Duckly video here:  <https://youtu.be/YzCPCRTIEPs>

#### Using the Duckly rooms

When you join our team you will see a left-side bar similar to the Discord panel. We have created a room per project as well as additional help tables: **Curie, Lovelace, Hopper, Turing, Ride, Barres and Johnson**.

![Duckly panel](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/840161206739664926/840221434839564330/Dashboard_-_Video_chat_with_real-time_collaboration_-_Duckly.png)

- **To join a room:** click on the room name. You can then choose your mic, camera, share your terminal and IDE.
- **To leave a room:**Click on the leave button on the top-right corner

!!!info
      Since Duckly does not have persistent text chats we are using both Discord and Duckly - let's keep Discord for text and Duckly for code walkthroughs and debugging.
